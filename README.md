> The **Euclidean rhythm** in music was discovered by [Godfried Toussaint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfried_Toussaint)
> in 2004 and is described in a 2005 paper
> "The [Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms".<sup>[[1]](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf)</sup>
> The [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
> of two numbers is used [rhythmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm)
> giving the number of [beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)) and
> silences, generating almost all of the most important
> [World Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Music) rhythms,<sup>[[2]](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/rhythm-and-mathematics.html)</sup>
> (except [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India#Performing_arts)).<sup>[[3]](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff-extended.pdf)</sup>
> The beats in the resulting rhythms are as equidistant as possible; the same
> results can be obtained from the [Bresenham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) algorithm.
